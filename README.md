# InferaDB

__The distributed inference engine for authorization, designed for fine-grained, low-latency environments.__

This repository orchestrates the InferaDB ecosystem, including the core policy engine (`server`), management API (`management`), and management dashboard (`dashboard`). It provides configuration, containerization, and deployment resources for running the full system locally or in the cloud.
